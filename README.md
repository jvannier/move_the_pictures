# Example of Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS Webpage that allows swapping images around

Intended to be a simplified example/learning aid for anyone wondering how you would do a small project like this in plain ol' Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

To run, simply open `index.html` in your browswer.

i.e. type `/Path/To/Directory/move_the_pictures/index.html` into your browser of choice.
